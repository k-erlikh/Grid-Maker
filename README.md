# Grid-Maker

<p> The purpose of this program is to create a near-perfect square grid on a rectangualar image. This is intended for people who might want to transfer digital media onto traditioal media (paper, canvas, etc.) while preserving proportions as close as possible. </p>

<p> Generally, it's only possible to have a perfect square grid on a rectangle who's side lengths are proprotional with whole number ratios. That's why in some examples, or images of your own, might have the last squares of a row or column be slightly larger or smaller than the rest of the squares.</p>

<p> Some tester images can be seen in the tester directory </p>
<img src='tester\test2_original.jpg' alt = 'original tester image of grey and white kitten' width='400' height =auto>
<img src='tester\test2_updated.jpg' alt = 'updated tester image of grey and white kitten with grid' width='400' height =auto>

<h2> How To Use </h2>

<p> Change "INSERT PATH HERE" on line 49 to: Original image path of your choice </p>
<p> Change "INSERT PATH HERE" on line 94 to: New (or original) image path of your choice</p>

<h2> Future Implementations/Goals </h2>
<ul> 
    <li>Create a user interface with different options and a preview of the image and grid </li>
    <li>Select different proprtions of grid if possible for that image </li>
    <li>Adjust color and thickness of lines on grid </li>
 </ul>

 <h2> Additional Notes </h2>
 <p> A virtual environment was created for this program. Information about the packages required can be found in the requirments.txt </p>
